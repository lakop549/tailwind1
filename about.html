            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Web security must be a critical priority for every organization.
              Along with email, the web is one of the top vectors for
              cyberattacks. The web and the use of DNS services specifically are
              part of 91% of all malware attacks, and email and web together are
              a key part for 99% of successful breaches. While the importance of
              web security is undisputed, protecting against web security
              threats grows more challenging each day. From thwarting attacks to
              dealing with limits in skills and resources, IT security
              departments face serious challenges when trying to secure the web.

              ChatGPT is an AI Chatbot developed by Open AI. The chatbot has a
              language-based model that the developer fine-tunes for human
              interaction in a conversational manner. Effectively it’s a
              simulated chatbot primarily designed for customer service; people
              use it for various other purposes too though. These range from
              writing essays to drafting business plans, to generating code. But
              what is it and what can it really do? If you are new to Chat GPT
